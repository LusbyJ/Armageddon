# Armageddon
Arm-ageddon is 2-D side scroller / platform shooter style game.  Created and built in Unity.  Arm yourself and see if you can survive.
## Game Overview
In Arm-ageddon, players take control of a robot with detachable arms.  They must survive an onslaught of enemies in a large, arena-like map, collecting various arms to use as weapons as they search for the P1N Key, which opens the door to beat the level.

Arm-ageddonâ€™s genres include: 2D, Platformer, Wave Survival, Shoot-em-up.  The target audience of the game is anyone who enjoys platformers with shooting mechanics.  Similar games on the market include older classics like Contra and Mega Man, as well as newer games like Super Crate Box and Cuphead.

The start of Arm-ageddon will have players start off powerless, with no arms.  They will find an arm close-by, which will give them unique abilities as a way of fighting off foes.  Players will then need to travel around the map, fighting off enemies along the way in order to collect additional arms and search for the P1N Key.  When players find it, they must then carry it back to a door near the start of the level to win.

The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting, and thus has a slightly dark feeling to it.  That being said, the game aims to not take itself seriously with a heavy emphasis on puns, undercutting the dark atmosphere a bit.

## GamePlay
The objective of Arm-ageddon is to search the level for the P1N Key, pick it up once found, and take it back to the start while surviving hoards of foes.

### Game Flow:
  * The player starts off in the level with no arms
  * The player finds arms to use in combat and is able to defend against foes
  * The player searches the level for the P1N Key
  * The player finds the P1N Key and picks it up after removing all equipped arms.
  * The player must return to the start of the level
  * The player exits the level and wins.
### Play Flow
The player fights enemies using arms, then finds new arms to replace the ones they lost as they search for the P1N Key.

## Mechanics
### Arms
Players can hold two arms at once, and can switch between them with the press of a button.  They can use a button to throw their arm, which makes it explode, and can also use its ability.  Each arm has its own unique ability, although most are used for combat.  When the player is hit by an enemy, the arm loses integrity.  The arm also loses integrity when its ability is used.  When an arm has no integrity, it is destroyed.  If players have an empty slot for an arm, they can pick up new ones they find throughout the map.
### Enemies
At certain intervals, enemies spawn to attack the player.  These enemies see the player from any distance and move towards them.  There are multiple kinds of enemies that attack the player in different ways.

### P1n Key
As they travel through the map, players may find the P1N Key.  They can pick it up if they have no arms and carry it.  It has integrity like other arms do, but takes up both slots and has no ability.  It is also placed down when dropped instead of destroyed.  When the player takes the P1N Key to the door at the start of the level, they win, but if the P1N Key is destroyed, they lose.

### Core Integrity
When the player takes damage with no arms, they lose a point of core integrity.  After taking 3 hits to the core, they die and must retry.

### Combat
B.E.A.R. uses different arm abilities for combat. Which includes melee weapons, and ranged weapons. Melee weapons have to make physical contact with the enemy, and ranged weapons fire projectiles that deal damage to enemies. The more B.E.A.R. uses the small-arms (get it?), the more damaged they become. When the arms are destroyed, B.E.A.R. must find a new one or risk (not having a helping hand) taking damage and losing the game. Like B.E.A.R., some enemies can attack with melee weapons and some can attack with ranged weapons.  Enemies are also affected by gravity, and jump along the platforms to fight B.E.A.R.
